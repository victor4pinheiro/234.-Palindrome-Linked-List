# 234. Palindrome Linked List

Difficulty: Easy.

## Description:

Given the ```head``` of a singly linked list, return ```true``` if it is a palindrome or ```false``` otherwise.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constrains**:
* The number of nodes in the list is in the ```range [1, 105]```.
* ```0 <= Node.val <= 9```.

**Follow up**: Could you do it in ```O(n)``` time and ```O(1)``` space?
